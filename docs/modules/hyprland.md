# Hyprland IPC

Two independent connections, both handled without any third-party Wayland-adjacent
IPC library — just raw AF_UNIX sockets + cJSON:

- **Request socket** (`$XDG_RUNTIME_DIR/hypr/$HYPRLAND_INSTANCE_SIGNATURE/.socket.sock`,
  `hyprland/ipc_request.c`): one connection per command (Hyprland's IPC doesn't
  pipeline). Write the command, `shutdown(fd, SHUT_WR)` (Hyprland only starts
  replying once it sees EOF on the write side — skipping this deadlocks), read to
  EOF, close. `j/<command>` gets JSON back (parsed with cJSON via
  `hyprland_ipc_request_json()`); plain commands like `dispatch ...` get plain text.
- **Event socket** (`.socket2.sock`, `hyprland/ipc_events.c`): one persistent
  non-blocking connection, registered on `main.c`'s epoll instance. Delivers
  `event>>payload\n` lines, which may arrive split across reads — `ipc_events.c`
  buffers and re-frames them. On any event that can change workspace
  occupancy/focus (`workspace`, `workspacev2`, `focusedmon`, `focusedmonv2`,
  `openwindow`, `closewindow`, `movewindow`, `movewindowv2`, `create`/
  `destroyworkspace[v2]`), it calls `workspaces_refresh()` (a fresh
  `j/workspaces` + `j/activeworkspace` query — no incremental delta tracking,
  deliberately, since re-querying is cheap at this event rate) and marks every
  output dirty only if the occupied set or the focused workspace changed (most
  window events change neither). If the connection drops (EOF/error), `ipc_events.c` returns `false`
  and **does not retry itself** — `main.c` owns the "attempt exactly one reconnect,
  then give up on live workspace updates for this run" policy, so that policy
  lives in one place instead of being split across files.
- **`hyprctl -j workspaces` objects already carry a `windows` count** — occupancy is
  just `windows > 0`; there's no need to separately query `clients`/toplevels the
  way the Quickshell/QML version does via `Hyprland.toplevels`.
- **Dispatch syntax is compositor-config-dependent, and this matters.**
  `hyprland/dispatch.c`'s `hyprland_dispatch_focus_workspace()` tries
  `dispatch hl.dsp.focus({ workspace = <id> })` **first** — **no surrounding
  quotes**. `hyprctl dispatch '...'` on the CLI only works because the *shell*
  strips those quotes before hyprctl sees them; this code writes straight to the
  raw socket with no shell involved, so literal quotes get rejected. This is confirmed to work on this
  machine's Lua-configured Hyprland (0.56.1), and matches what the reference
  Quickshell bar's own click handler sends **unconditionally, with no fallback at
  all**.
  - **`hl.dsp.exec_raw("workspace <id>")` looks like it should be the "right"
    config-agnostic escape hatch** (it exists specifically to run a classic
    dispatcher string under a Lua config, per the Hyprland wiki and a related
    Waybar issue) — but on this exact build it returns `ok` without actually
    switching the workspace, confirmed live against the socket. **Don't reach for
    it as a fix without re-testing it directly against the socket first** — it
    looked correct on paper and wasn't.
  - Only if the Lua form is rejected does the code fall back once to the classic
    `dispatch workspace <id>` syntax (for compatibility with non-Lua configs), and
    logs to stderr if *that* also fails, instead of failing silently.
  - **Which form actually worked is cached in a static `DispatchStyle` after the
    first call** (a given Hyprland instance's dispatch style doesn't change at
    runtime). On this machine's Lua config, the very first attempt already
    succeeds, so **no stderr output should ever appear in normal use**. If you see
    rejection messages in the log -- especially repeated ones -- this regressed.

## In the Rust port

- **Files:** `src/hyprland/mod.rs` (request socket), `src/hyprland/events.rs` (event socket),
  `src/hyprland/dispatch.rs` (`Dispatcher`), `src/modules/workspaces/mod.rs` (pills).
- **Requests** use a blocking `UnixStream` with a **1 s read/write timeout**, because they run on
  the main loop as in C and a stuck Hyprland mustn't freeze the bar. As before:
  `shutdown(Write)` first, then read to EOF.
- **Events:** the socket is a calloop source. A read with any relevant line triggers one
  re-query, and bars redraw only if the occupied set or the focused id changed. On EOF/error
  the source removes itself and sets `App::hyprland_events_lost`, and `main.rs` reconnects
  exactly once.
- **Pills are `ClickTarget`s** (`render::ClickTarget`, `Action::FocusWorkspace`): spots inside
  the `workspaces` box that a left click acts on. The box itself isn't clickable, so the gaps
  between pills do nothing and keep the arrow cursor.
- **Testing:** `tests/test_workspaces.py` runs the bar against `tests/lib/fake_hyprland.py`
  (`HYPRLAND_INSTANCE_SIGNATURE` pointing at a temporary socket directory). Never point a
  workspace-click test at the real Hyprland: it would switch the user's workspace.
